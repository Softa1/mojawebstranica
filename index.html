<h5>PUBG is a player versus player shooter game in which up to one hundred players fight in a battle royale, a type of large-scale last man standing deathmatch where players fight to remain the last alive.</br> 
Players can choose to enter the match solo, duo, or with a small team of up to four people. </br>
The last person or team alive wins the match.</br>
Each match starts with players parachuting from a plane onto one of the eight maps which have different sizes and terrain.</br>
 The plane's flight path across the map varies with each round, requiring players to quickly determine the best time to eject and parachute to the ground.</br>
 Players start with no gear beyond customized clothing selections which do not affect gameplay.</br>
 Once they land, players can search buildings, ghost towns and other sites to find weapons, vehicles, armor, and other equipment.</br> 
 These items are procedurally distributed throughout the map at the start of a match, with certain high-risk zones typically having better equipment.</br>
 Killed players can be looted to acquire their gear as well.Players can opt to play either from the first-person or third-person perspective, each having their own advantages and disadvantages in combat and situational awareness; though server-specific settings can be used to force all players into one perspective to eliminate some advantages.</br>
Every few minutes, the playable area of the map begins to shrink down towards a random location, with any player caught outside the safe area taking damage incrementally, and eventually being eliminated if the safe zone is not entered in time; in game, the players see the boundary as a shimmering blue wall that contracts over time.</br>
This results in a more confined map, in turn increasing the chances of encounters.</br>
During the course of the match, random regions of the map are highlighted in red and bombed, posing a threat to players who remain in that area.</br>
In both cases, players are warned a few minutes before these events, giving them time to relocate to safety.</br>
A plane will fly over various parts of the playable map occasionally at random, or wherever a player uses a flare gun, and drop a loot package, containing items which are typically unobtainable during normal gameplay.</br> 
These packages emit highly visible red smoke, drawing interested players near it and creating further confrontations.</br>
On average, a full round takes no more than 30 minutes.</br>
At the completion of each round, players gain in-game currency based on their performance.</br>
The currency is used to purchase crates which contain cosmetic items for character or weapon customization.</br>
A rotating "event mode" was added to the game in March 2018.</br>
These events change up the normal game rules, such as establishing larger teams or squads, or altering the distribution of weapons and armor across the game map.
The game's concept and design was led by Brendan Greene  </h5>
